# Process Scheduler

FIFO (First In First Out)

```
$ python scheduler.py -p FIFO
ARG policy FIFO
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 10
ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 9 )
  Job 1 ( length = 8 )
  Job 2 ( length = 5 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 9.00 secs ( DONE at 9.00 )
  [ time   9 ] Run job 1 for 8.00 secs ( DONE at 17.00 )
  [ time  17 ] Run job 2 for 5.00 secs ( DONE at 22.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 9.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 9.00  Turnaround 17.00  Wait 9.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 17.00  Turnaround 22.00  Wait 17.00

  Average -- Response: 8.67  Turnaround 16.00  Wait 8.67

RR (Round Robin)

```
$ python scheduler.py -p RR
ARG policy RR
ARG jobs 3

ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 9 )
  Job 1 ( length = 8 )
  Job 2 ( length = 5 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job   0 for 1.00 secs
  [ time   1 ] Run job   1 for 1.00 secs
  [ time   2 ] Run job   2 for 1.00 secs

  [ time  21 ] Run job   0 for 1.00 secs ( DONE at 22.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 22.00  Wait 13.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 1.00  Turnaround 21.00  Wait 13.00

SJF (Shortest Job First)

```
$ python scheduler.py -p SJF
ARG policy SJF
ARG jobs 3

ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job:
  Job 0 ( length = 9 )
  Job 1 ( length = 8 )
  Job 2 ( length = 5 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 2 for 5.00 secs ( DONE at 5.00 )
  [ time   5 ] Run job 1 for 8.00 secs ( DONE at 13.00 )
  [ time  13 ] Run job 0 for 9.00 secs ( DONE at 22.00 )
